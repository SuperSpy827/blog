Koga was born from the concept of Â¢88 domains. It uses the [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) theme made by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) *(which uses the MIT license)* as a starting point. 

This is where I share my projects, code snippets and thoughts. If you find anything I say offensive, please refer to [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Close-Tabs) link for help.

I can be contacted through my [Gmail](mailto:therealkoga@gmail.com) account, feel free to hit me up with any suggestions about anything!
